# fnder [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/TomJamesGray/fnder.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/TomJamesGray/fnder)

fnder is a program allowing to search for things locally or online, similar to Mac OS's spotlight search. It's in the early stages of development but the planned sources of data are:

* A local wiki, where articles are written in markdown and rendered in the program's GUI (in progress)
* Search Github repos of a specific user (in progress)
* Fuzzy search for files
* Search for weather 
* Search wikipedia
* and more(?)
